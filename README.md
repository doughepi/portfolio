# Portfolio

This is the main repository for my combination blog and portfolio site that is continuously deployed with Terraform and GitHub Workflows. 

You can read more about the motivation behind creating this portfolio and blog on the first blog post that I wrote.

[How I deployed this blog.](https://piper.codes/blog/how-I-deployed-this-blog?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=github_readme)

## Docusaurus

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Deployment documentation is coming soon.
